This is the same basic website with a Bootstrap Navbar. 
> Bootstrap navbars offer a quick solution to navigating our page.

The website consists of the following three files:
1. index.html 
> This HTML file contains a header, a lorem ipsum paragraph, a link to a lorem ipsum generator, and a link to the Bootstrap Navbar website. You will also see a Bootstrap CDN link, as well as a link to the style.css and app.js files. 

> The Bootstrap Navbar requires additional JavaScript for certain functionality, which is included at the bottom of the file.
2. style.css 
> The CSS file only centers the header on the page.
3. app.js 
> The JavaScript file only prints "Hello" to the console.
